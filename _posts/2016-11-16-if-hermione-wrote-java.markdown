one of the most intriguing things about programming is the communicative aspect. to
invent a language to speak to the computer, that is clear enough that humans can understand
it when reading it years and years later, while also making a program that works in a way that it
will be understood by a third person who's using it.

coding is like literature. coding is like inventing an reading and writing and
interacting and logic at the same time. to invent a language to speak to the computer, while
speaking. to write a history about something happening while making it happen. basically it's magic.

when I was little I wanted to invent stuff. then I wanted to be a chimney sweeper.
then I wanted to be a writer. then I wanted to be a matematician. then I wanted to be hermione granger,
and finally I thought that what is most important in life is communication and people understanding each other.
to do programming is being all of those things at once. except the chimney sweeper.
