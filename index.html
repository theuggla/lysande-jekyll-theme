<section id="about">
    <p>one of the most intriguing things about programming is the communicative aspect. to
    invent a language to speak to the computer, that is clear enough that humans can understand
    it when reading it years and years later, while also making a program that works in a way that it
    will be understood by a third person who's using it.</p>
    <p>coding is like literature. coding is like inventing an reading and writing and
    interacting and logic at the same time. to invent a language to speak to the computer, while
    speaking. to write a history about something happening while making it happen. basically it's magic.</p>
    <p>when I was little I wanted to invent stuff. then I wanted to be a chimney sweeper.
    then I wanted to be a writer. then I wanted to be a matematician. then I wanted to be hermione granger,
    and finally I thought that what is most important in life is communication and people understanding each other.
    to do programming is being all of those things at once. except the chimney sweeper.</p>
